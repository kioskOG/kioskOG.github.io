# Secure Connectivity to SAP HANA Private Cloud via xxxxx GCP Project


## 🚀 Overview
This proof-of-concept (PoC) document outlines Solution 2 for securely accessing SAP HANA Private Cloud (PCE) resources through the xxxxx GCP Project, leveraging self-hosted VPN and DNS for centralized control and ease of management.

The solution enables both on-premise (office) and remote users to securely access SAP services over a private network, without exposing the SAP HANA environment publicly.

## 🧪 Proof of Concept Goals

✅ Enable secure, **client-to-site VPN** connectivity for internal and remote users

✅ Establish **VPC Peering** between GCP and SAP PCE networks

✅ Centralize **DNS resolution** in GCP for internal SAP domains (`*.sap.xxxxx.team`)

✅ Isolate access—users get **access only via VPN**, nothing exposed publicly

✅ Test domain resolution and service access (e.g., `abc.sap.xxxxx.team`, `def.sap.xxxxx.team`)



## 🔐 Connectivity Flow
**Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### 1. VPN Setup (Client-to-Site)
Users (office or remote) connect to a **Self-Hosted VPN** running in the xxxxx GCP project.

### 2. DNS Resolution
VPN clients receive the internal DNS IPs (e.g., `10.0.0.10`, `10.0.0.20`) via configuration. These DNS servers are configured using `Bind9` to resolve SAP internal domains.

### 3. VPC Peering
The GCP VPC (10.0.0.0/16) is peered with the SAP PCE VPC (10.1.0.0/16), allowing transparent routing between the environments.

### 4. Service Access
Once connected, users can access internal SAP services like:

* `abc.sap.xxxxx.team`

* `def.sap.xxxxx.team` These resolve via DNS and route through the peered VPC.




## 🛠️ Implementation Details

> Fill in these sections based on your specific setup.

### 🧩 NetBird Setup on GCP

* VPN server deployment on a GCP VM

* User key distribution and client config

* Allowed IPs: `10.0.0.0/16`, `10.1.0.0/16`

* Routing and NAT configuration

### 📘 Bind9 DNS Configuration

* Custom zones for:

   * `sap.xxxxx.team`

   * Reverse DNS (PTR) for SAP IP ranges

* Forwarders for internet or SAP DNS cluster

* Access control based on VPN subnet
