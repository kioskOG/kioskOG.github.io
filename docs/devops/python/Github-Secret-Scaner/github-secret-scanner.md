# 🔐 GitHub Secrets Scanner

An end-to-end automated system that scans GitHub repositories for leaked secrets (like AWS keys, Slack tokens, private keys, etc.) on every code push. When a secret is detected, it sends a real-time email alert and logs the finding into a Kafka topic.

> Built for developers, security engineers, and platform teams who want early warnings about leaked credentials in their GitHub workflows.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ GitHub webhook integration (triggered on push)
- 🔍 TruffleHog v3-based secrets scanning (filesystem mode)
- 🔁 Kafka integration for streaming findings
- 📩 Email alerts (SMTP-based) on detection
- 🧪 Fully testable with real GitHub repos and dummy secrets
- 📚 Easy to extend to Slack, Jira, or SIEM tools

---

## 🛠 Architecture Overview

```
GitHub Push
    ⬇️
Webhook (FastAPI)
    ⬇️
TruffleHog Scan (Filesystem)
    ⬇️
Kafka Topic (secrets.scan.results)
    ⬇️
Kafka Consumer
    ⬇️
Email Alert (SMTP)
```

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12**  – API + scanning + consumer
- **FastAPI** – Webhook server
- **TruffleHog v3** – Secrets detection
- **Kafka (via Docker)** – Messaging backbone
- **Kafka-Python** – Kafka producer/consumer
- **SMTP** – Email sending (Gmail or others)

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+
- GitHub repository (public or private)
- Gmail account for SMTP (App Password required)

---

🛠 Step-by-Step Plan for the POC

Step | Task | Goal
1 | Set up a GitHub repository | Create a simple repo to push code
2 | Set up a Webhook listener (local dev first) | Receive GitHub push/PR events
3 | Trigger GitHub Event → Webhook locally | Validate we are receiving events
4 | Integrate TruffleHog scan | Scan commits for secrets
5 | Push scan results to Kafka topic | Set up Kafka and produce scan result
6 | Set up Kafka consumer | Consume the scan result
7 | Send email if secrets found | SMTP or email API integration
8 | Final polishing | Error handling, retry, logging

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

{: .note}
> I have used the trufflehog binary in this case, if you want you can use trufflehog version 3 python library as well.
>
> Install trufflehog using installation script

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kioskOG/secret-scan-poc.git
cd secret-scan-poc
```

### 2. Setup Kafka with Docker Compose

Edit `docker-compose.yml` with your EC2 IP (for advertised listeners).

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. 🛠 Create Kafka Topic

```bash
# SSH into the Kafka container
docker exec -it kafka bash

# Create a topic
kafka-topics --create --topic secrets.scan.results --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --bootstrap-server kafka:9092

# Verify Topic Creation
kafka-topics --list --bootstrap-server kafka:9092
```

### 4. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Start FastAPI Webhook Listener

```bash
uvicorn webhook_listener:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 6. Setup GitHub Webhook

1. Make Sure EC2 Security Group Allows Port 8000

✅ Go to your EC2 dashboard → Select your instance → Security Groups → Inbound Rules


2. Set Webhook in GitHub Repo
✅ Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook

Fill it like:

Field | Value
Payload URL | http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8000/webhook
Content type | application/json
Secret | (keep empty for now, or we can set later)
SSL verification | Disable (only because it's http, not https)
Which events would you like to trigger this webhook? | Just the push event (or both Push + Pull Request later)


Click Add Webhook.

✅ GitHub will immediately ping your server and expect a 200 OK response.

{: .note}
> make sure your fastapi is running


Once you add the webhook, you will see the somelike like below

```json
✅ Received Webhook Event:
{
  "zen": "Design for failure.",
  "hook_id": 543511348,
  "hook": {
    "type": "Repository",
    "id": 543511348,
    "name": "web",
    "active": true,
    "events": [
      "push"
    ],
    "config": {
      "content_type": "json",
      "insecure_ssl": "1",
      "url": "http://13.201.70.227:8000/webhook"
    },
    ...
```

### 7. Start Kafka Consumer (Email Alerts)

Update `consumer.py` with your Gmail credentials and run:

```bash
python3 consumer.py
```

✅ Done! Push secrets to GitHub and watch the magic.

---

## 📩 Email Configuration

Edit the `consumer.py` and set:

```python
sender_email = "your@gmail.com"
password = "your-app-password"  # from https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
recipient_email = [{"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}]
```

---

## 🔐 Testing Secrets

Add fake credentials to a test file in your repo:

```python
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
SLACK_WEBHOOK = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

Push the file and see TruffleHog + Kafka + Email in action!


### Example Email

![mail-image](/docs/devops/python/Github-Secret-Scaner/mail-image.png)

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|------|-----|
| `NoBrokersAvailable` | Check Kafka listener IPs and FastAPI config |
| `TruffleHog scan failed` | Ensure correct TruffleHog binary path and permissions |
| Email not sending | Use App Password + enable less secure apps |

---

## 🧱 Roadmap

- [ ] Add Slack/Jira integrations
- [ ] Add HTML dashboard for scan history
- [ ] Dockerize entire system with healthchecks
- [ ] Secret rotation suggestions using AWS APIs

### ⚡ Should You Integrate TruffleHog into GitHub Actions Instead of Your Own Code?

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| TruffleHog in GitHub Actions | ✅ Very easy to set up<br>✅ No server management<br>✅ Direct scan on PRs/Pushes<br>✅ GitHub-native logs and alerts | ❌ Can't easily integrate with Kafka (unless you code a custom GitHub action or webhook output)<br>❌ Limited customization of post-processing (like customized Kafka message, complex flows) |
| TruffleHog from Your Own Webhook Server | ✅ Full flexibility: scan, push to Kafka, custom alerting<br>✅ One place to control workflow<br>✅ Can scale later easily (multiple repos, central dashboard) | ❌ More infra to manage (webhook server, background workers) |


> 🎯 My Honest Suggestion

If your goal is just lightweight scan (alert on finding credentials),
then GitHub Actions is faster and enough.

> But if you want a full pipeline like:

Webhook → Trufflehog → Kafka → Email (or Slack alert, Jira ticket),
then own server-based approach is better (more flexible + enterprise ready).
